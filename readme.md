[How much of the world's food do smallholders produce?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2018.05.002)

Code for this app was heavily heavily borrowed from the awesome folk at [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org). Check out their much better doucmentation [here](https://github.com/cmgiven/open-election-map), but feel free to use and adapt our repo as needed.
