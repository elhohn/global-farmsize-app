Crop_Diversity,Crop Diverstiy,"<strong>Crop diversity</strong><br><br>Crop diversity is a simple count of how many unique crop species each farm size produced (this is also called 'species richness' in the biodiversity literature). Many countries' surveys only captured a set number of crops so there isn't much difference between farm size classes. For the countries that captured a lot of different crops (e.g., Peru and Colombia) <a href=""https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tp63z6dz5g/1"" target=""_blank"">our data </a>  shows a big difference between small and large farms.<br><br><strong>Farm size responsible for majority of diversity</strong>",,diversity
