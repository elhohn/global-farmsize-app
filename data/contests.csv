total,Total,"<strong>Total crop production in kilocalories/capita/day.</strong><br><br>We converted all tonnes of production to kilocalories so we can compare across all crops. <a href=""https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tp63z6dz5g/1"" target=""_blank"">In our dataset, </a>we also converted production to fats and proteins.",,
food,Food,"<strong>Food production in kcal/capita/day.</strong><br><br>We converted all tonnes of production to kilocalories. Then we applied the percent of feed, food, processing, seed, waste, or other based on FAO's food balance sheets. For example, in many countries maize can be used for human consumption, animal feed, a processed biofuel commodity, and seed, while some maize may be lost due to storage and transportation. <a href=""https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tp63z6dz5g/1"" target=""_blank"">In our dataset, </a>we split up or sub-national production data based on the FAO's national allocations.",,
grossarea,Gross Area,"<strong>Gross Cropping Area in hectares (ha)</strong><br><br>We also found out that smaller farms use less area to produce more than larger farms. Gross area is the total area that a farm uses in a given year. If the farmer has two cropping seasons in a year, their cropping area is two times their fields. This is useful when working out farmers' yields.",,
