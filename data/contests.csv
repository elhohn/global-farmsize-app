production_Total_kcal,Total Production,"<strong>Total crop production in kilocalories</strong><br><br>We converted all tonnes of production to kilocalories so we can compare across all crops. <a href=""https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tp63z6dz5g/1"" target=""_blank"">In our dataset, </a>we also converted production to fats and proteins.",,
Gross_Area,Gross Agricultural Area,"<strong>Gross agricultural area</strong><br><br>Gross agricultural area refers to how much land a farmer plants on in a given year. If they use the same field twice (for two seasons), it gets counted twice. Interestingly, you'll find that some farms produce a a lot more on a smaller amount of land. Since the 1920s researchers have found smaller farms have higher yields (production per hectare) than larger farms - we found this in our data too!",,
production_Food_kcal,Food,"<strong>Food production in kilocalories</strong><br><br>We converted all tonnes of production to kilocalories. Then we applied the percent of feed, food, processing, seed, waste, or other based on FAO's food balance sheets. For example, in many countries maize can be used for human consumption, animal feed, a processed biofuel commodity, and seed, while some maize may be lost due to storage and transportation. <a href=""https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tp63z6dz5g/1"" target=""_blank"">In our dataset, </a>we split up or sub-national production data based on the FAO's national allocations.",,

Crop_Diversity,Crop Diverstiy,"<strong>Crop diversity</strong><br><br>Crop diversity is a simple count of how many unique crop species each farm size produced (this is also called 'species richness' in the biodiversity literature). Many countries' surveys only captured a set number of crops so there isn't much difference between farm size classes. For the countries that captured a lot of different crops (e.g., Peru and Colombia) there is a big difference between small and large farms.",,
